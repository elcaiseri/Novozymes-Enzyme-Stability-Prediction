## About
This repository contains the 21st place solution for the Novozymes Enzyme Stability Prediction competition. The solution is based on the idea "**Representation Is All You Need.**"

For more information about the competition, idea, experiments, and results, see the [discussion here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction/discussion/393308).

## Codeflow
The solution is divided into three stages:
1. ThermoNet predictions.
2. Extract representations and XGBoost predictions.
3. Ensemble with different features.

## Workspace
The code and solution were developed in a Kaggle notebook.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this competition is from the Kaggle competition itself.
